## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
TIKTOK: the app tiktok is a friendly users interface. because it is easy to use, uploading videos or scrolling videos. it also use strong algorithms to display your preferences in the screen
INSTAGRAM: I like instagram because of its adds, and how people use the app to sell products...
FACEBOOK: facebook has implemented more features such as dating app, or markeplace.. which makes the app util to use.
 An app that I would like to build would look like tiktok, with more features like large scale video uploading, also with two segmentations, one for vido only and the other one for pictures.

## Notes

I DID NOT ENCOUNTERED ANY CHALLENGES WHILE BUILDING THE APP.
